## Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a relational database schema for an online shop using PostgreSQL.  
The database includes entities such as sellers, categories, buyers, products, orders, order details, reviews, and the relationships between them.  
The goal of the project is to demonstrate effective data modeling, relational integrity, and structured query usage through SQL.  
The system supports core e-commerce functionality including order management, product classification, customer feedback, and supplier tracking.
